# Centre for Artificial Intelligence (CAI)
## University of Wollongong

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the Centre for Artificial Intelligence (CAI) at the University of Wollongong. CAI conducts pioneering research to develop innovative theories and techniques of AI, and transferring the knowledge and technologies to industry, community and society.
### Our Mission
The CAI aims to become an internationally renowned research group in AI, engaging with diverse stakeholders including industry, community, and society to address their business challenges through cutting-edge AI technologies.

### Research Focus Areas
Our expertise spans across several key areas of artificial intelligence, including but not limited to:

- **Machine Learning**: Developing algorithms that improve automatically through experience.
- **Computer Vision**: Enabling computers to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos.
- **Multi-agent Systems**: Systems composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents.
- **Big Data and Applications**: Techniques for analyzing, systematically extracting information from, or otherwise dealing with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software.
- **Multimedia Signal Analysis**: The analysis of signals that encode information.
- **Probabilistic Model Checking**: A formal verification technique for the modelling and analysis of stochastic systems.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Enabling computers to understand and process human language.
- **Distributed Computing**: Systems in which components located on networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages.
